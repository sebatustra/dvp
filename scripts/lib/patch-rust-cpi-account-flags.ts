/**
 * Works around a bug in @codama/renderers-rust (present through v3.1.0).
 *
 * The generated CPI builder stores remaining accounts as tuples of
 * `(account, is_writable, is_signer)` (the documented `add_remaining_account`
 * argument order), but the generated invoke helper serializes them as
 * `is_signer: remaining_account.1, is_writable: remaining_account.2`, reading
 * `.1` (is_writable) as the signer flag and `.2` (is_signer) as the writable
 * flag. A caller who appends a readonly-signer extra as `(acct, false, true)`
 * gets a writable-non-signer AccountMeta instead. On ReclaimDvp, whose fixed
 * signer is readonly, the privilege union can upgrade that extra to a writable
 * signer forwarded into a transfer hook.
 *
 * Rewrite the two mapping lines so `.1` feeds is_writable and `.2` feeds
 * is_signer, matching the tuple order. A no-op if upstream fixes the template.
